# Contributing to the Serializer

If you wish to contribute to this project, you are always welcomed to make a PR (Pull Request) or report a bug.

## 🐞 Reporting bugs

Please use the **Bug report** issue template when opening bug reports (click **New issue → Bug report**). The template collects the information we need (Unity/BepInEx/BepInSerializer versions, reproduction steps, and logs such as `BepInEx/LogOutput.log`).

## ✨ Pull requests

How to submit a PR:

1. Fork the repository and create a branch (e.g. `feat/short-description` or `fix/short-description`).
2. Implement your change and **test** before adding to PR.
3. Keep a clear description of the problem and your solution.
4. **Make sure** to **not remove the dependencies** of the original project. Unless you're adding _new_ dependencies or updating existing ones.
5. Open a PR against `master` and reference the related issue.

In the same way that issues has a template, PRs also contain a **checklist template** of their own. When writing a new Pull Request, make sure to satisfy the **conditions** of the checklist before sending your work.
